# dotfiles

I decided to create this repo to backup my dotfiles, but also to share what I use. Sharing my dotfiles is important to me as it is a way to give back to the community. I was inspired by a few repos on GitHub and it helped me tremendously in my quest to fine-tune my setup. I use Linux, more specifically Lunar Linux and Obarun, so be aware that I haven't used my dotfiles on another OS or Linux distribution.

## Quick Install
